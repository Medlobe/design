                  Become a Medical Practitioner Becoming a medical practitioner
                  involves rigorous education, residency training, and a
                  commitment to patient care. Practitioners diagnose illnesses,
                  prescribe treatments, and promote health. Strong scientific
                  knowledge, communication skills, and compassion are essential
                  for success.
